# week2-assignment

- i completed all the requirements
- i know how to do everything seperately ( the js stuff; loops, arrays, functions etc), but putting it all together and knowing when to use them was a little tricky
- i also found enabling the keydown function quite hard, i dont think i understand fully what i did :\  and it was quite a long process
